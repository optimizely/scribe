[[intro]]

Here, add a brief description of about one sentence that states what the customer's business is all about.

[[/]]

Here, introduce the person profiled in the story, if applicable, and their testing challenges and so forth.

## This is a heading

Keep going, describe what their challenges are and why Optimizely is their favorite experience optimization platform of all time.

{% include "blockquote.html"
  {
    size: 'full',
    quote: 'Maybe you’ll want to use a block quote to describe just how painful their life was before Optimizely.',
    attribution: 'Johnny Personalization, Head Honcho, Fortune XXX Company'
  }
%}

Introduce the concepts of their experiment. Make sure to pad elements like the pull quote and other modules with text - try not to let them bump up against each other.

## Hypothesis

Set up the key components of their test, state their hypothesis. Feel free to *bold the hypothesis* so a scanning reader can find it more easily.

Then, set up the variations in the experiment and describe them before dropping them into the story:

{% include "side-by-side.html"
  {
    images: [
      'https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/customer-stories/customer-stories-pages/liftopia/product-before.png',
      'https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/customer-stories/customer-stories-pages/liftopia/resort-before.png'
    ],
    caption: 'In this original flow, the visitor would land first on a calendar of dates (Left), and then select a resort (Right). Both pages had many options for cross-selling and additional searching.'
  }
%}

You can use the side-by-side module for 2 or 3 images, or you can use the figure module for just one image.

{% include "figure.html"
  {
    image: 'https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/customer-stories/customer-stories-pages/obama2012/mobile-donate-test.png',
    caption: 'The variation experience (Right) tested adding imagery of the president to the mobile experience to try to increase donations.'
  }
%}

## Results

Keep the results section short and to the point, and try to *bold the key findings*.
